About
======

Hi! I'm Austin Meek. I'm currently a MATS scholar, where I'm working on a variety of different topics, but primarily evaluations for chain-of-thought monitoring. I'm also a PhD student where I study a mix of machine learning and computational neuroscience topics. I'm interested in understanding how to build safe AI systems, especially as they scale in capability, and understanding how intelligence is constructed generally.

This website is currently under construction! More will be filled in soon.
